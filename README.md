# Welcome

This training is based on the excellent *Practical Python Programming*
course by David Beazley, adapted and condensed for internal use.
It focuses on core Python concepts, real-world scripting practices,
and Pythonic patterns that experienced engineers can immediately apply.
While the structure follows the original closely, we've modified examples
and added material that aligns with the tools and workflows commonly
used in our projects — including libraries like `argparse`, `pathlib`, and`pydantic`.

The goal: help engineers quickly gain confidence with Python, understand its
idioms, and comfortably modify and extend Python-based tooling in our environment.

## What is This?

The material you see here is the heart of an instructor-led Python
training course used for corporate training and professional
development. It was in continual development from 2007 to 2019 and
battle tested in real-world classrooms.  Usually, it's taught
in-person over the span of three or four days--requiring approximately
25-35 hours of intense work. This includes the completion of
approximately 130 hands-on coding exercises.

## Target Audience

Students of this course are usually professional scientists,
engineers, and programmers who already have experience in at least one
other programming language. No prior knowledge of Python is required,
but knowledge of common programming topics is assumed.  Most
participants find the course challenging--even if they've already been
doing a bit of Python programming.

## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python
programming with an emphasis on script writing, basic data manipulation, and
program organization.  By the end of this course, students should be
able to start writing useful Python programs on their own or be able
to understand and modify Python code written by their
coworkers.

## Requirements

To complete this course, you’ll need a basic installation of
Python 3.6 or newer. We recommend using Visual Studio Code as
your editor of choice, along with the official Python extension. VS
Code offers an excellent development experience with built-in support
for running scripts, managing virtual environments, and navigating code.

## What This Course is Not

This is not a course for absolute beginners on how to program a
computer.  It is assumed that you already have programming experience
in some other programming language or Python itself.

This is not a course on web development.  That's a different
circus. However, if you stick around for this circus, you'll still see
some interesting acts--just nothing involving animals.

This is not a course on using tools that happen to be written
in Python. It's about learning the core Python language.

This is not a course for software engineers on how to write or
maintain a one-million line Python application. I don't write programs
like that, nor do most companies who use Python, and neither should
you. Delete something already!
