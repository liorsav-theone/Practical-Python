# 7. Advanced Topics

In this section, we look at a small set of somewhat more advanced
Python features that you might encounter in your day-to-day coding.
Many of these topics could have been covered in earlier course
sections, but weren't in order to spare you further head-explosion at
the time.

This section also introduces the use of external third-party
Python packages that are not included in the standard library
but provide powerful capabilities for real-world applications.
Pythonâ€™s ecosystem is one of its greatest strengths, and
learning how to leverage high-quality external libraries is
essential for writing modern, maintainable code.

It should be emphasized that the topics in this section are only meant
to serve as a very basic introduction to these ideas.  You will need
to seek more advanced material to fill out details.
